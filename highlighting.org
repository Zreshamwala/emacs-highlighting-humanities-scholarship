* Highlighting

Note: 
If your config is directly in init.el or .emacs, then copy just the source block at the end. 
If your emacs config is in org-mode, this entire file (in its text form) can be copied into it and the examples 
will demonstrate the highlighting in action.


1. Citations with the following variants should work:
   - [@source 45-46]
   - [-@source 45-46]
   - [qtd in @source 23-24]
2. Quotations in LaTeX Style, that is ``quoted matter" will be highlighted ``as so". It is a non-greedy regexp so that /the words between two matches/ in the same line are not highlighted.
3. Emphasis in italics such as for /Book Titles/ or /terminology/ will be highlighted.
4. Citations containing page numbers or page ranges in MLA style will be highlighted.
